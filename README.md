Do you love pets? Luckily, the Pet Shop mod allows you to fully experience having a pet in Minecraft!

Currently, there are three species of pets that you can adopt - cats, dogs, and parrots. Each of these pets try to mimic exactly how pets act in real life. Besides having funny and cute animations, each pet also has extensive AI that allows you to have a full experience of having a pet.

## What can your pets do?

Each pet has three modes: Stay, follow, and wander. To change your pet’s activated mode, simply crouch and right-click your pet with an empty hand. The current mode of the pet will be displayed on screen.

Each pet also has a **hunger and thirst** level. Like real-life pets, you need to make sure your pets are constantly well-fed and have adequate water! Get some pet bowls from the Pet Groomer villager (ideally one for food and one for water). Fill one with kibble (using a kibble packet) and one with water (using a water bucket), and then from there, your pets will automatically eat and drink when they are hungry.

Cats and dogs can **sleep** with a proper animation! This mod adds new pet beds (a small and large size) which you can place down. If there is a pet bed near which isn’t occupied, pets will sleep when it’s night time (only if they are set to wander).

Both dogs and cats can play **fetch** with you! Simply acquire a tennis ball, right click it to throw, and watch as your pets scurry for the ball and then return it to you.

If you don’t have a brush with you, no problem! Dogs can** dig up suspicious blocks** for you! They don’t give you the item though, so you have to go and get the dug-up item yourself.

You can **put parrots on your shoulder**! Simply right click your parrot while it is on stay mode and it will go on your shoulder. You can also choose to put your parrots in bird cages - if you right click an empty bird cage while you have a parrot on your shoulder, the parrot will transfer to the bird cage.

You can give all of your pets **treats**! Each type of pet has a dedicated pet treat item. Dogs have a dog bone treat, cats have a tuna treat, and parrots have peanuts. Holding these items in hand will attract the attention of your pets (and they will display a cute animation). 

And lastly, you can **pet your pets** by simply right clicking them. Who doesn’t want a little love?

## Pet Supplier Villager

How do you get your pets? Through the new Pet Supplier villager! Found randomly in regular villages, you can trade some emeralds for special **pet items**. These pet items “contain” your pet. You can summon your pet using this item. If your pet dies, you can simply re-summon it using your pet item. If your pet wanders too far, you can hold your pet item in hand and they will follow you. And finally, if you have lost sight of where your pet is, you can simply right click the ground with the pet item (putting the pet back in the item) and right click the ground to summon it right next to you.

## Pet Groomer Villager and Grooming Station

You have your pet, which is great; how can you upgrade it even further? How about… giving your pets cosmetics?

With the new Grooming Station block, you can decorate your pet with some cool cosmetics! Simply put your pet item (making sure it contains your pet) in the top left slot, and your wool (the cost) in the bottom right. Click one of the options that displays on the left (either boots, collars, or hats) and then take the new pet item that displays on the right.

The Pet Groomer villager is responsible for selling a lot of items in the mod, including kibble, playing items, pet bowls, and pet beds.

## What is Planned For the Future?

We still plan to add a lot more to this mod. Planned:

- More pet species 
- More variants to existing species
- More items to interact with your pets

Potentially planned: 

- Pet park jigsaw structure
- Special leashes
